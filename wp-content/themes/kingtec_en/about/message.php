        <p>The Kingtec Group is a best described as a blazing furnace, a coming-together of people from the four corners of the world, that, having relinquished self-interest in favor of the common good, are bonded together by, and in, the pursuit of a shared ambition. </p>
        <p>The Kingtec family strives to create a socially-responsible enterprise, one that society and its constituents can trust in and rely on. Dedication to our trade, loyalty to our cause, mutual respect, and fellowship among peers are the standards that we hold ourselves to, and those through which we have become a highly effective team creating recognized and trusted products. We are, however, never satisfied with our efforts, never complacent in our work. We espouse a culture of simple, effective work, and constantly reiterate the need to further our studies, both of our trade and of ourselves. </p>
        <p>In China there is an expression: "In Spring the flowers bloom, but not until Autumn do they yield their fruit." As is true for flowers, so is it true of our undertakings. In the first 20 years of our history we have suffered the hardships of building a company, and have reaped the fruits of our labor. But at is is with the coming and going of the seasons, so too are past accomplishments relegated to the past, and new ones must be envisioned to take their place. It is in this spirit of renewal that we continue to strive forward in the pursuit of new successes, all while continuing to uphold the values that have served us so well in the past. </p>
        <p style="float:right">Xie Bi Xiang, Chairman of the Board</p>
