    <p>Established in 1989, Kingtec has grown to be one of China’s leaders in the development and production of reinforced-fiber cement board and calcium silicate board in China. The company owns and operates factories in Guandong, Jiangxi, Xinjiang, and Hubei provinces of China. Our largest facility, in Yichun City, Jiangxi province, has an annual output of 20 million square meters of fireproofing board. All of our plants were designed to meet European and American standards of production, with some of our head engineers having previously worked for the top fireproofing board manufacturers in Europe.</p>
    <p>Kingtec products are consistently rated higher than nationwide industrial production standards. Their use is recommended by the China Academy of Building Research as part of their list of  “Preferred Building Materials,” and our designs have been used as the design example in three of their publications: “Walls and Ceilings Standards,”  “Ventilation Duct Standards”, and “Non-metallic Duct Standards.” Kingtec is an accredited ISO 9001 Quality Management System implementing company.</p>
    <p>At Kingtec, we also have a strong sense of environmental responsibility. All of our products are asbestos-free, we are a certified ISO 140001 Environmental Management System implementing company, and we are the first company in China to have both a fireproofing certificate and environment protection certificate for the same product.</p>
    <p>Kingtec building materials are widely used in many famous, large-scale projects across China. Some of these include: the Beijing Olympics Bird’s Nest Stadium, the Beijing Olympics Indoor Stadium, the 2010 Shanghai Expo Chinese Pavilion, the Beijing Subway, the National Theater of China, Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, and the Shanghai F1 Swoop Platform.</p>
